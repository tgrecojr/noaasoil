# NOAA Soil Data Extractor  

This project pulls down soil temperature (5 and 10 cm below the surface) and ambient temperatures and inserts into InfluxDB v2.  

The intent of this project is to use this information to drive data driven decisions about lawn fertilization and pre and post emergent applications.  As an example, pre-emergent split applications are most effective when the soil temeratures reach 50 degrees F.  Using this data will help predict when application will be most effective.
